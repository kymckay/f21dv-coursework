      <h1>Great British Birth Names</h1>
      <p>
        The names we give to things can tell us a lot about our history and
        culture. Do the names we give our children reveal how we've changed over
        time? Do they show distinct regional differences?
      </p>
      <p>
        By comparing baby names (through the years 1996â€“2020) chosen in Scotland
        to those chosen in England and Wales perhaps we can find out.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to the top 10</h2>
      <p>
        To start with, let's look at the top 10 names through the years and how
        they move around.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that some names are persistent while others come and go. In
        Scotland, Jack is present the entire time from 1996 to 2020 (even ending
        as the most popular). Lewis springs up in 1998 and sticks around for two
        decades until 2018. One of Emma or Emily is also present for the entire
        24 year period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, in England and Wales, Jack sits as the most popular name all
        the way until 2008 and then remains present until 2020. William appears
        in 2004 shortly followed by Harry in 2006, possibly inspired by
        the royal princes. George joins the ranks in 2014 (possibly following
        the birth of Prince George in 2013) and quickly rises to the 2nd most
        popular spot through to 2020.

      <h2>Frequency of initials</h2>
      <p>
        You may notice that initials in the set of least popular names tend to
        start with letters towards the end of the alphabet. This may be
        unsurprising since chapter lengths in any English dictonary would
        suggest they're less common leading letters. However, it does prompt a
        question: which letters are the most common initials and how does the
        distribution change through the years?
