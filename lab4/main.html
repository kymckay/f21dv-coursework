      <h2>Frequency of initials</h2>
      <p>
        You may notice that initials in the set of least popular names tend to
        start with letters towards the end of the alphabet. This may be
        unsurprising since chapter lengths in any English dictonary would
        suggest they're less common leading letters. However, it does prompt a
        question: which letters are the most common initials and how does the
        distribution change through the years?
