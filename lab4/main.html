      <h1>Great British Birth Names</h1>
      <p>
        The names we give to things can tell us a lot about our history and
        culture. Do the names we give our children reveal how we've changed over
        time? Do they show distinct regional differences?
      </p>
      <p>
        By comparing baby names (through the years 1996–2020) chosen in Scotland
        to those chosen in England and Wales perhaps we can find out.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to the top 10</h2>
      <p>
        To start with, let's look at the top 10 names through the years and how
        they move around.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that some names are persistent while others come and go. In
        Scotland, Jack is present the entire time from 1996 to 2020 (even ending
        as the most popular). Lewis springs up in 1998 and sticks around for two
        decades until 2018. One of Emma or Emily is also present for the entire
        24 year period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, in England and Wales, Jack sits as the most popular name all
        the way until 2008 and then remains present until 2020. William appears
        in 2004 shortly followed by Harry in 2006, possibly inspired by the
        royal princes. George joins the ranks in 2014 (possibly following the
        birth of Prince George in 2013) and quickly rises to the 2nd most
        popular spot through to 2020.

      <h2>A macroscopic view of name popularity</h2>
      <p>
        Having observed the changes in rank among the most popular names, it
        seems as though some stay steadily popular while others drop off or pop
        up. By taking a look at the full history of a wider set of names, we can
        see how typical it is for their popularity to remain steady.
      </p>
      <div class="pop-charts">

        <div id="pop-ew"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        One interesting case is the name Aria in Scotland. It appears to quickly
        gain and lose popularity between 2005 to 2010, at which point it
        steadily gains enough to belong to the top 50 most popular names in
        2020. While speculative, it's fun to note that the Game of Thrones HBO
        series first aired in 2011, which features a popular character names
        Arya.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's quite clear from these charts that there's a lot of osciliation
        among names that aren't consistently ranked at the very top — some
        exhibiting such large swings in popularity. This raises a question:
        which names have seen the biggest swings in popularity?
      </p>
      <div class="pop-charts">
        <div id="swing-s"></div>
        <div id="swing-ew"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        These charts provide a more interesting view on the constantly swaying
        public opinion of some names. This time there is even a clear cultural
        influence, with the names Aria and Arya in Scotland plus Aairah and
        Ariyah in England and Wales all seeing significant increases in
        popularity following the year 2011 when Game of Thrones first aired.
      </p>
      <h2>Frequency of initials</h2>
      <p>
        You may notice that initials in the set of least popular names tend to
        start with letters towards the end of the alphabet. This may be
        unsurprising since chapter lengths in any English dictonary would
        suggest they're less common leading letters. However, it does prompt a
        question: which letters are the most common initials and how does the
        distribution change through the years?
