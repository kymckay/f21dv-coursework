      <h1>Great British Birth Names</h1>
      <p>
        The names we give to things can tell us a lot about our history and
        culture. Do the names we give our children reveal how we've changed over
        time? Do they show distinct regional differences?
      </p>
      <p>
        By comparing baby names (through the years 1996–2020) chosen in Scotland
        to those chosen in England and Wales perhaps we can find out.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequency of initials</h2>
      <p>
        You may notice that initials in the set of least popular names tend to
        start with letters towards the end of the alphabet. This may be
        unsurprising since chapter lengths in any English dictonary would
        suggest they're less common leading letters. However, it does prompt a
        question: which letters are the most common initials and how does the
        distribution change through the years?
